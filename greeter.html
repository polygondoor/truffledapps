 <!-- In the next block of code we load all our javascript dependencies.

Web3.js is the library that does all the work interacting between our JS and the contract. Web3.js allows us access to all our 
geth/eth commands via javascript (normally just add _web3._ to the beginnning of the eth command). 

jquery is a common library used to simplify, extend, and abbreviate standard javascript functions.
It has become almost standard in the development of javascript projects.

Finally app.js is our dApps javascript code...
