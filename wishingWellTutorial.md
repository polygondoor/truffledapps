## Wishing Well Front-End Development using Truffle Framework

This is the beginning of a tutorial that extends our inital foray into Ethereum dApp front-end development using the truffle framework. This tutorial builds a front end for the Bouncing Wishing Well Contract written by Etienne Deleflie.

This contract front-end demands the writing of transaction to the blockchain and therefore requires knowledge regarding the creation of accounts in Geth. The front-end will need to unlock the default local geth acccount (later to be ported to metamask) and then use that account to submit a deposit the contract.

There is still a long way to go here. The current script doesn't succesfully return any information about the state of the contract. It does however demonstrate the call of contract functions and interaction with accounts. 

I'll update this as I sort through the many challengaes I'm runnning into
